										<h2 class="major">IT Development</h2>
										<p>My love for computers started with programming languages like Python and C++. Python’s ease of use helped me explore many areas, including artificial intelligence, while C++ taught me the importance of performance, especially in game development. AI technology fascinates me with its potential to create smart systems, and combining it with game development opens up endless possibilities. The more I learn, the more I appreciate the power of computers to create and innovate.

										<h2 class="major">Gameplay Appreciation and Planning</h2>
										<p>Gameplay Appreciation and Planning are crucial in game design. Appreciation involves understanding what makes a game fun, such as its mechanics, challenges, and story. It helps identify what works well and what doesn’t. Planning, on the other hand, is about designing the game’s mechanics, setting goals, balancing difficulty, providing feedback, and creating a smooth experience. Together, these aspects help designers create engaging and enjoyable games. <p>

										<h2 class="major">Aesthetics and Art</h2>
										<p>In game development, game technology and artistic aesthetics come together to create not only a functional but also a visually captivating experience. Game technology focuses on the technical foundation—optimizing performance, ensuring interactivity, and creating seamless gameplay. However, artistic aesthetics goes beyond mere visuals; it reflects the deeper understanding of beauty—how form, color, and design evoke emotion and immerse the player in a unique world. The beauty of a game is not just in its graphics but in how its artistic elements resonate with the player's feelings and perceptions. Emphasizing individuality in artistic choices allows the game to express a unique identity, making it stand out. When combined, technology and art create an experience where every detail, from the code to the canvas, tells a story and reflects the game’s character.</p>
