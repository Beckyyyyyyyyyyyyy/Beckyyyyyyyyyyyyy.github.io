									<h3 class="major">Functions</h3>
									<p>The world is like a function. What you input becomes either a beautiful memory or a trauma in your mind. In the future, it will be output as motivation or an emergency response. The interesting thing about the world is that the inputs for everyone are different, and you can freely decide what to input.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Code</h3>
									<p>Code is the tool and weapon for an individual to survive in the world. You can freely choose the way to achieve success. For example, a solid foundation in C language, the universal and pure nature of Python, the specialization of C#, and the rigorous power of C++.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Data Structures</h3>
									<p>To unlock a skill, you need to apply its characteristics. Use loop structures to simplify problems with patterns, use pointers to store memory and access variables to deal with problems based on experience, use stacks to manage various needs and desires, use recursion to achieve compound interest and high efficiency, and use control flow statements to design strategies.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Open Source</h3>
									<p>Of course, you don't have to understand everything valuable in the modern world from scratch. Human wisdom can be connected through platforms, and the bond is open-source software. However, reading a hundred times is not as effective as going out and trying. You need to use the source code to implement projects and refine the fit through application.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Machine Learning and AI</h3>
									<p>The world is not short of "whales" (big spenders) who, through the accumulation of predecessors, have a system that automatically creates value. They are not lacking in tools and strategies. Their needs can be met by others through a converter. They just need to obtain real-time data from the outside to make decisions.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Architecture</h3>
									<p>Once you learn to use tools and strategies to determine the entire operation, you can create your own masterpiece in life. Life is systematic and multidisciplinary. People's anxiety often comes from seeing the vastness of life in advance and feeling powerless. The code contained in a project often requires knowledge in many areas. Don't rush. Whether it's developing a work or living in this world, both are very interesting and valuable. They require curiosity and passion. Let's make our living environment better and better. Thank technology for its progress. I hope we can appreciate and use powerful technology well and become a part of the technological era.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Frontend</h3>
											<p>The process of building and designing user interfaces for Unity front-end GamePlay, especially focusing on PvE, PvP, and surrounding systems, is centered on the interaction between users and applications. It encompasses multiple aspects, including design and implementation, performance optimization, and security protection, with a strong emphasis on user experience and design aesthetics.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Backend</h3>
											<p>Building and maintaining the server-side is like being a digital superhero. You handle logic, databases, speed, and security. It’s all about making a reliable system to keep users happy and safe. And oh, if network engineering and cybersecurity were your sidekicks, you’d be unstoppable!</p>
